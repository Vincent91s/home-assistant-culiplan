"""Static guards on the sidebar panel's stylesheet (custom panel height).

The panel is registered with ``component_name="custom"`` and
``embed_iframe: False``. HA does not give ``<ha-panel-custom>`` a definite
height in that configuration, so a percentage height on ``:host`` resolves to
``auto``: the host shrinks to content height and the iframe collapses with it.
A reporter measured the whole chain at 1344x150 in a 1600x1000 viewport —
nav bar, one card, then empty page background for the rest of the screen.

The fix is a viewport-relative height. These tests parse the stylesheet text
rather than render it; they exist to stop ``height: 100%`` from creeping back
onto ``:host``, which is the exact regression that produced the collapse.
